# Synthlab
Modular Synthesizer Studio

Synthlab is in fact a simple Reaktor clone. It allows you to build synthesisers in a graphical manner.

It's a JUCE project, so simply go to juce.com and download the framework. 
Then start the projucer and open the project file in order to generate your platform configuration.

# Notice
This is a project at a very early stage but works already good. I currently neither has any docs or tutorials or something.
To get the thing running you can use the projucer. But if you would like to have support you're probably alone an your way.

But do not hesitate to dig into the code and make Synthlab a better place. ;)

Feel free to contact me for questions.
